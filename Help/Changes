Version 003-alpha (2006-09-10)
* Big changes!
* Refactored to support other mailbox types (IMAP, POP, MBOX)
* Support notification-daemon (if pynotify installed)
* Icon changes
* Only report new messages in the Tooltip.
(Testing release - lots of error checking probably needed, Account editor needed.)

Version 002 (2006-01-17)
* Pass readonly=True to IMAP4.select() command.  Without this, another 
connection may take over the mailbox and raise an exception.
* Add option to play sound when new mail arrives.

* First release
