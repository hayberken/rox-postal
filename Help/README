Postal
A mail check applet for the ROX panel.
by Ken Hayber

Brief
~~~~~
Postal simply reports the unseen and total message counts for each requested
account in a tooltip.  It changes its icon when any unseen messages are found.

If dbus, notification-daemon and pynotify are installed, you get nice popup 
messages when new mail arrives.

Currently three account types are supported: IMAP4, POP3 and MBOX (local file)
The accounts are stored in an INI file using the following format.

[0]
name: ImapAccount
protocol: IMAP
server: imap.myserver.com
port: 143
ssl: False
username: myname
password: mypassword
folders: Inbox,Other,Folder,Names
polltime: 2

[1]
name: PopAccount
protocol: POP
server: pop.myisp.com
port: 110
ssl: False
apop: False
username: myname
password: mypassword
polltime: 10

[2]
name: LocalMail
protocol: MBOX
filename: /var/spool/mail/username
polltime: 10

The [section] names can be anything, they don't have to be numbers.
If there is any problem with the Accounts.ini file, the file is opened in the
default text editor.  If the file is missing, a template is created and opened.


See the TODO file for possible future additions.
